                                    <p> I love people. I love problem solving. Successfully navigating both is what makes me unique. If
                            you're looking for great communication skills, high EQ, and attention to detail, let's talk.
                            I'm currently enrolled in Vanderbilt University's full stack coding boot camp, with a
                            January completion date. My background in accounting and sales offer high attention to
                            detail and excellent communication skills. I own my own personal training business because
                            passion is important to me, too. If there is a challenge, personally or professionally, I
                            want it. And I want to help you.
                                    </p>
